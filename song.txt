The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion.

As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous.
